# # Streambook example

# Streambook is a setup for writing live-updating notebooks
# in any editor that you might want to use (emacs, vi, notepad).



import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import time

# ## Main Code

# Notebook cells are separated by spaces. Comment cells are rendered
# as markdown.
#
# See https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#the-light-format

x = np.array([10, 20, 30])


# Cells that end with an explicit variables are printed. 
#
# See https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html#magic-commands

x


# Dictionaries are pretty-printed using streamlit and can be collapsed

data = [dict(key1 = i, key2=f"{i}", key3=100 -i) for i in range(100)] 


# Pandas dataframe also show up in tables. 


df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df



df.plot()


x = "hello"
# Printing
print("Printing", x)
print("Printing2", x)
"Output", x


# ## Advanced Features


# By default, the notebook is rerun on save to ensure
# consistency.

def simple_function(x):
    return x + 10
y = simple_function(10)
y


# Slower functions such as functions are loading data
# can be cached during development.

@__st.cache()
def slow_function():
    for i in range(10):
        time.sleep(0.1)
    return None
slow_function()


# This uses streamlit caching behind the scenes. It will
# run if the arguments or the body of the function change.

# See https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/caching.html


# ## Longer example

# ## Exporting to Jupyter

# The whole notebook can also be exported as a
# Jupyter notebook.

# The command is:
#
# `streambook convert example.py`
